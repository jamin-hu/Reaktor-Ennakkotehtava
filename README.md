# Reaktor-Ennakkotehtava

For the ennakkotehtävä, I ultimately chose to tackle task 2, and its accompanying 4 and 5.

In other words, **my goal** was to create an app that could **visualize the historical as well as predicted future global temperatures where latitudes and longitudes could clearly be seen.**

So as a result, this task will be split into several parts.

1. A small demo of the **visualization** can be seen by running the file *"VisualizationDemo.html"* (Tasks 2, 4). **WARNING!:** The visualization produces a flickering artifact when being used and may cause discomfort and/or seizures for those with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.
2. The **Deep Learning NN architecture** that generated those images and the evaluation/error margins of the model can be found in the following google colaboratory online jupyter notebook. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gtu1elOlxB5slLdQuzBm8-7_FEe-rj58 (Task 4)
3. **Sequence Diagram** describing how information flows between databases, a backend, and the front end considering monthly updates. (Task 5)

Each of these folder contains their own *read me* which will help introduce the folder and its contents further.

Here is a sneak peak into the action that lies ahead!
