# Reaktor-Ennakkotehtava

For the ennakkotehtävä, I ultimately chose to tackle task 2, and its accompanying 4 and 5.

In other words, **my goal** was to create an app that could **visualize the historical as well as predicted future global temperatures where latitudes and longitudes could clearly be seen.**

So as a result, this task will be split into several parts.

1. A small demo of the **visualization** can be seen by running the file *"VisualizationDemo.html"* (Tasks 2, 4). **WARNING!:** The visualization will produce a flickering artifact when being used and may cause discomfort and/or seizures for those with photosensitive epilepsy. Viewer discretion is advised.
2. The code that generated those images and predictions including the **Deep Learning NN architecture** behind it can be found in the following google colaboratory online jupyter notebook. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gtu1elOlxB5slLdQuzBm8-7_FEe-rj58 (Task 4)
3. **Designs for the user interface** including the updating of data in the folder Design (Task 5)

Here is a sneak peak into the action that lies ahead!
